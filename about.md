Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Mechanical and Robotics Engineering](https://me.gist.ac.kr/meeng/index.do){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at [GIST](https://www.gist.ac.kr/en/main.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Republic of Korea. My research focuses on understanding human perception of 2D and 3D environments, developing geometry-based deep learning methods, integrating analytic geometric priors with modern neural architectures, and designing AR/VR/MR remote-collaboration platforms.

I study the practical obstacles people face in 2D and 3D tasks and build geometry-informed AI systems that genuinely help them. By combining modern deep learning with explicit geometric structure, I aim to deliver AR, VR, and MR platforms that are reliable, efficient, and easy to use in day-to-day collaboration.

I will receive my Ph.D. from the School of Integrated Technology at GIST, advised by Prof. Kwanghee Ko in the [MODSIM](https://me.gist.ac.kr/modsim/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} Lab, with the degree to be awarded at the Winter Commencement Ceremony in February 2026.
