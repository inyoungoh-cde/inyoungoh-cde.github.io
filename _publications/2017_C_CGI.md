  This paper addresses the problem of detecting multiple spheres in a point cloud generated by the Kinect. The radii of spheres in the point cloud are not provided a priori. A novel algorithm is developed to detect curvature information, cluster relevant points using curvature, estimate spheres, and corresponding radii. Once curvature is estimated at each point of the point cloud, a statistical method is introduced to group points with a similar curvature. Each group is then used for sphere estimation. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, which shows a successful estimation of spheres with various radii from a point cloud.
